# PLUGINS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

Nuxt will automatically read the files in your `plugins/` directory and load them. You can use `.server` or `.client` in the file name to load a plugin just on server- or client-side.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/plugins).
