# COMPOSABLES

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

Nuxt will soon support a `composables/` directory to auto import your Vue composables into your application when used, learn more on the [open issue](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/issues/639).

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/composables).
